/*Learning a lot from the mistakes :

1. Tried to reappear to old questions and got stuck up first and then actually solves it

2.Tried to force doing the questions after recognizing the pattern easily which made 
 me stuck and forget the question in my next time of attempt 

3. Stucking and applying another methods to my questions in my second visit tells me 
 that i need to create an example on my own to properly understand the question and
 commit a blunder like applyig another methods damn it
